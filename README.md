# Detecting-Pig-Health-Conditions-through-Acoustic-Event-Detection
Classification of pig breathing sounds using prototypical network with k-means clustering and query attention

# Setup

Download the required python package listed in requirements.txt
(not all packages are required)

# How to run

Simply run
```=python
python3 file_name.py
```
You can also adjust the configuration of each file by modifying the parameters at the beggining of each file

The results will be directly outputed into the pwd.

P.S. run.sh is how I run multiple experiments at once.
